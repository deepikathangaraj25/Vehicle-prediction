# REVOLUTIONIZING ROAD SAFETY FOR ADVANCED VEHICULAR ACCIDENT PREDICTION
# Application
  This project developed a real-time vehicle tracking system designed to optimize traffic flow and enhance road safety, particularly at road curves. The system leverages computer vision techniques to accurately detect and track vehicles, providing valuable insights for traffic management and monitoring.
# Technologies
  Computer Vision: Multi-scale Detector (a customized YOLO architecture) for object detection and a fusion of DeepSORT and Centroid Sort algorithms for vehicle tracking.
Dataset: A custom dataset was created to train the models, with augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
LED Display: A real-time display board provides information on vehicle types, passage time, and vehicle count to oncoming traffic.
